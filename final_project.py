Because of this implementation, our program gets faster and faster as it is used by the client, especially in the cases when a stock is suitable for the client's needs multiple times.

# To determine weights, scale follows a tournament style strategy. It selects pairs to be balances and calls the balance function.

Then, the two groups are concatenated, to form a list, the balance of which has been determined. This continues till the whole list becomes a single whole.
#

# Using the functionality that allows us to assign weights to a given list of stocks, we can have a function that generates various portfolio options for us to choose from. This helps with the randomization of the process with `n` number of iterations. We atain this randomness by shuffling the list of stocks everytime before passing it in to `scale` function, so that the last two items popped are always different.
# 
# However, it is important to note that once the `n` value exceeds the permutation of the stock number, i.e., portfolio size, shuffling loses it's meaning as there are only `permutations of size` number of ways to order the stocks. Hence, we use 20 as `n`, which is lower than the permutation of 4 (our lowest number of stocks possible for a portfolio) to avoid inefficiencies.

# ## Selecting the Best Portfolio Among All Options
# 
# Although risk assessment is crucial, the main goal of investment is maximizing profit, i.e., maximizing returns. Hence, the final step of selecting the best portfolio is focused on maximizing returns, instead of picking the portfolio with highest VaR.
# 
# There are two considerations: once selected, the best portfolio should have a mean greater than 0 and VaR above risk tolerance (i.e., risk lower than risk tolerance). If these criteria are not met, the following happens.
# 
# The portfolio option with the next possible mean is selected and checked. If none of the options meet criteria, we try to improve the portfolio option selected in the very beginning. To do so, the stock with the lowest weight is swapped with another. To select which stock is suitable to replace it, the the first stock in the `working_list`is considered and checked for whether it has the same `sector` as the stock to be removed. If not, the next one is considered. If suitable, a new stock list with the swap in place, is passed into the best_portfolio function to find the appropriate weights and evaluate the suitable portfolio, repeating the process.
# 
# In the swapping process, if no suitable stocks with the same sector is found till the end of the `working_list` the program tells the client that the preferences indicated were not compatible with stocks at hand, recommending the user to alter them.
